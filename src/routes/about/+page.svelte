                My work explores the intersection of memory and space. Through
                photography and video, I attempt to capture the quiet moments
                that often go unnoticed—the way light hits a dusty surface, or
                the stillness of an abandoned room.

                I believe that art should be a contemplative experience. By
                removing color and focusing on form and texture, I invite the
                viewer to project their own emotions onto the canvas of the
                image.

                Based in New York, but constantly traveling to find new
                perspectives.
